HGDP database APIs tutorial

Welcome to the HGDP database APIs tutorial.
This document will show you how to download these apis and how to use them to connect to my local hgdp database.

################################################################################
1. Download and Installation from Github
The source code for these APIs is hosted on my online account on github:
- http://github.com/dalloliogm/snps-database/tree/master

It is recommended to use git to download the code, because this way it will be easier to keep the code update after.
In case something goes wrong, you can find a 'download' link in the same page.
If you want to contribute with code changes to the APIs, it would be easier if you open an account on github and store your branch of code there.
It would be better for me, too, because then I will be able to change the repository into a private one and it will be better.


################################################################################
1b. Accessory libraries and modules needed
There is a tool called 'easy_install' which is the official one used to download python packages (like CPAN for perl or CRAN for R).
It is recommended to use it to install automatically all the modules indicated below, because it will save you time.

On an Ubuntu/Debian distribution, you can install easy_install with this command:
$: sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
Otherwise, follow the instructions here:
- http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

After installing easy_install, execute the following commands:
$: sudo easy_install -U "nose>0.10" "sqlalchemy>0.5" "elixir>0.6" ipython
the program will download and install automatically some files, and then you will be ready to use the APIs.
Note that you can use easy_install to download most of the modules for python.


################################################################################
1c. Configuring the connection
Once downloaded and unzipped, you should have a directory like this:
|-- bugs
|-- data
|   |-- Annotations -> /home/gioby/Data/HGDP/Annotations/
|   `-- Genotypes_by_chr -> /home/gioby/Data/HGDP/Genotypes_by_chr/
|-- docs
|   |-- Slides
|   |-- UML
|   |-- tutorial
|   `-- use cases
|-- src
|   |-- HGDPIO
|   |   `-- test
|   |-- profiles
|   |-- schema
|   |   |-- recipes
|   |   `-- tests
|   |-- setupdb
|   |-- sql_queries
|   |-- test
|   `-- utils
`-- test

Enter the 'src' directory: you will see a file called 'config_template.txt'.
Open it and enter the parameters for your connection, and then save it as 'config.txt' in the same directory.


################################################################################
Testing and using the APIs
In the src folder, there is a file called 'Makefile'. It contains some shortcuts to repeat some of the commands used more often.
Execute 'make test' from the src dir (you will need to have the program 'make' installed, but most of the Linux distributions already have) to execute some tests:
- if you see any error which looks like 'Import error', it means that you need to install some other library. Tell me because it means that I forgot to put it.
- if you see any error which looks like 'connection error', check the parameters you put in config.txt.
