title: "RefSeqGene.get_snps: upstream and downstream intervals, snps that fall in other genes"
desc: |-
  RefSeqGene.get_snps gets all the snps in an interval of (upstream, downstream) bases from the cdsStart and cdsEnd of a gene.
  What should we do with the snps which falls in other genes? Should I ignore the problem? or should I remove them?
