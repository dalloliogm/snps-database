# This file collect use cases for our HGDP project, e.g.: how are we going to use it, which operations.
# This documentation will be of great help when we will design the database, so please contribute if you have ideas.

1. Storing HGDP data
	We are going to store all HGDP data into the database.
	HGDP is ~536.000 SNPs, over ~600 individuals, so we will have at least a table with 10^6 rows.
	The tables with HGDP data should be read-only - it should be not possible to modify them after they have uploaded.


2. Accessing to data using scripts
	We will have to access to the HGDP data almost on a daily basis, mostly via R, perl and python scripts.
	This could be done via ORM (Object Relational Mapping) modules, or via SQL.

4. Storing results 
	The results of analysis done with HGDP data could be stored as flat files, or in the database itself.
	Smaller result data could be saved in files, since it would be easier than creating new tables and modifying database's structure.
	Larger results, especially those that are going to be used later for further calculations (e.g. Fst for every pair of population), could be saved in the database.
	
	
5. Manually browsing database to check if data is ok
	It would be useful to have a view where one can browse the data to check if it is ok. 
	This could be done with any database management software - pgadmin, mysqladmin, etc... 
	
	
6. Knowing when an entry has been changed for the last time
	It would be useful to known when a row in the database has been last changes.
	For example, there it could be an error in a SNP's data, that we want to fix in the database.
	Later, we should always to be able to know with which data we were working when we calculated any kind of results at a certain time.
