# This file collect use cases for our HGDP project, e.g.: how are we going to use it, which operations.
# This documentation will be of great help when we will design the database, so please contribute if you have ideas.

1 - Storing HGDP data
	We are going to store all HGDP data into the database.
	HGDP is ~536.000 SNPs, over ~600 individuals, so we will have at least a table with 10^6 rows.
	The tables with HGDP data should be read-only - it should be not possible to modify them after they have uploaded.


2. Accessing to data using scripts
	We will have to access to the HGDP data almost on a daily basis, mostly via R, perl and python scripts.
	This could be done via ORM (Object Relational Mapping) modules, or via SQL.

4. Storing results 
	The database could also contain results
