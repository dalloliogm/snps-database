# This file collect use cases for our HGDP project, e.g.: how are we going to use it, which operations.
# This documentation will be of great help when we will design the database, so please contribute if you have ideas.

	
1. Calculate Fst pairwise for every population in HGDP
	We would like to calculate the Fst for every pair of populations in the HGDP panel.
	The results will be stored in a database table (~10^8 records).
	We will have to create a table with the Fst by population, and one with Fst by Continent.
	
	
2. Calculate EHH test for every SNP (in every population?)
	EHH is a test to detect recent positive selection from a set of Haplotypes 
	(http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/nature01140.html#abs)
	Step required to calculate EHH for a SNP:
	- select a SNP and its chromosome 
	- select all the SNPs in the same chromosome (or in a long range of distance from it)
	- select the haplotypes relative of these SNPs in the individuals of interest
	the rest of the calculation will be made by a script external to the database.
	It could be useful to have the haplotypes expressed as '01' blocks, as many exiting programs require that kind of input.
	
	
3.  Getting the full sequence of a gene containing a SNP
	It would be good to have a quick link to the gene entry in "ncbi - gene"/ensembl/ucsc/other databases
	
	
4.  Inserting data from HGDP files
	data from HGDP will be in a tsv file (tab separated file, using spaces)
