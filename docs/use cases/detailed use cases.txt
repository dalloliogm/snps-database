# This file collect use cases for our HGDP project, e.g.: how are we going to use it, which operations.
# This documentation will be of great help when we will design the database, so please contribute if you have ideas.

	
1. Calculate Fst pairwise for every population in HGDP
	We would like to calculate the Fst for every pair of populations in the HGDP panel.
	The results will be stored in a database table (~10^8 records).
	We will have to create a table with the Fst by population, and one with Fst by Continent.
	
	
2. Calculate EHH test for every SNP (in every population?)
	Is it possible to calculate EHH with only SNP data?
	
	
3.  Getting the full sequence of a gene containing a SNP
	It would be good to have a quick link to the gene entry in "ncbi - gene"/ensembl/ucsc/other databases
	
	
4.  Inserting data from HGDP files
	data from HGDP will be in a tsv file (tab separated file, using spaces)
